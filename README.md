Strings:

Text data: Hold characters enclosed in quotes ('' or "")
Immutable: Can't be directly changed after creation (think fixed text)
Indexing/Slicing: Access characters by position (index) or extract substrings ([start:end])

Lists:

Ordered collections: Contain items within square brackets ([])
Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or changed (flexible storage)
Heterogeneous: Can hold different data types (numbers, text, etc.) in one list
Indexing/Slicing: Similar to strings, access elements by index or extract sublists
In short:

Strings: Fixed text you can't rewrite.
Lists: Flexible storage for various data types that you can modify

Loops in Python let you repeat a block of code multiple times. Here's a quick breakdown in 5 lines:

for loops: Iterate over sequences (lists, strings) or generate numbers using range().
while loops: Execute code as long as a condition is true.
Indentation: Defines the code block that repeats within the loop.
break statement: Exits the loop prematurely.
continue statement: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
